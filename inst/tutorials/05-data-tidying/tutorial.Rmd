## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 5: Data tidying](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. We use the [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) package to create "tidy" data, defined as:

> 1. Every column is a variable.
> 2. Every row is an observation.
> 3. Every cell is a single value.

Key functions include [`pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) and [`pivot_wider()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html).


## Tidy Data
### 

You can represent the same underlying data in multiple ways by organizing values in a given dataset in different orders. But not all data is equally easy to use.

### Exercise 1

The following tables show Tuberculosis cases in three countries: China, Brazil, and Afghanistan.

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="30%", out.height="40%",fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/table1.png","images/table2.png","images/table3.png"))

```

### 


They all show the same data (country, year, population, cases), but one of them is going to be way easier to work with. Let's see if we can identify the "tidy" table.

###

Let's  take a look at `table2` first. Type and run `table2` in the box below to see it.

```{r tidy-data-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidy-data-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
table2
```

```{r tidy-data-1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
table2
```

```{r tidy-data-1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

`table2` is a tibble with 4 columns and 12 rows. Let's see if the rules apply.


### Exercise 2

These are the rules for tidy data: 

1. Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
2. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
3. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.

### 

In the column `type`, it switches in between `cases` and `population`. In the column `count` it also switches in between the number of cases and the population. 

### 

Using the three rules, answer the question below.

```{r tidy-data-2-q}
question("Are all the possible variables columns?",
	answer("Yes"),
	answer("No", correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE)
```

### 

All the possible variables are `country`, `year`, `cases`, and `population`. The `type` column has two of the variables that are not observations, breaking the first two rules. The `count` column has observations that switch between cases and population, because there is no `cases` or `population` column.


### Exercise 3

Now let's look at `table3`. Type and run `table3` in the box below to see it.

```{r tidy-data-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidy-data-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
table3
```

```{r tidy-data-3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
table3
```

```{r tidy-data-3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

Now, this looks like a very nice dataset with 3 columns and 6 rows, but it breaks one of the rules. These are the rules for tidy data: 

1. Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
2. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
3. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.


### Exercise 4

Using the three rules, answer the question below.

```{r tidy-data-4-q}
question("Are all the cells a single value?",
	answer("Each cell is a single value.", correct = TRUE),
	answer("Each variable is a column"),
	answer("Each observation is a row"),
	random_answer_order = TRUE,
	allow_retry = TRUE)
```

### 

Each of the cells in the `rate` column are not a single observation. They are `population` divided by `cases`, so in order for the data to be considered tidy, we would need to separate those columns.

### Exercise 5

Let's look at `table1`. Type and run `table1` in the box below to see it.

```{r tidy-data-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidy-data-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
table1
```

```{r tidy-data-5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
table1
```

```{r tidy-data-5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

`table1` is a tibble with 4 columns and 6 rows. Let's see if the rules apply.

### Exercise 6

As a refresher, these are the rules for tidy data: 

1. Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
2. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
3. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.

### 

Using the three rules, answer the questions below.


```{r tidy-data-6}
question("Are all the rules true in this data?",
	answer("Yes", correct = TRUE),
	answer("No"),
	allow_retry = TRUE)
```

### 

This is a very good example of a tidy dataset. All the variables are columns. All the columns are variables. All the observations are rows, all the rows are observations, all the values are cells, and all the cells are single values.

### Exercise 7

dplyr, ggplot2, and all the other packages in the tidyverse are designed to work with tidy data.

Using `table1` add a new variable `rate` which is equal to `cases / population * 10000`.


```{r tidy-data-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidy-data-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
table1 |>
  mutate(... = ...)
```

```{r tidy-data-7-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
table1 |>
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
```

```{r tidy-data-7-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 8

Make a plot with `ggplot`. 

Use `table1` as your data.

Add `aes()` with the `x` argument set to `year` and `y` set to `cases`.

Add `geom_line()` to your plot too.

```{r tidy-data-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidy-data-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(..., aes(...)) + 
  geom_...()
```

```{r tidy-data-8-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(data = table1,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = cases)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r tidy-data-8-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

We clearly don't want to connect the data points in this way.

> “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”
> — Leo Tolstoy

> “Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.”
> — Hadley Wickham

### Exercise 9

In `geom_line()`, we need to mess around with a couple things in order to get three separate lines instead of one big "N" on our plot. We need to add an `aes` inside of `geom_line()`, with `group` equaling `country`.

```{r tidy-data-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r tidy-data-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  geom_line(aes(... = country))
```

```{r tidy-data-9-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(data = table1,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = cases)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country))
```

```{r tidy-data-9-check}
grade_this_code()
```

The `group` aesthetic causes **ggplot2** to create separate lines for each value of `country`, which is what we want.

### Exercise 10

Now, let's improve the plot by adding a second `geom`, `geom_point()`. Inside `geom_point()` we need another aesthetic, this time with `color` and `shape` both equaling `country`. This will make three distinctive lines that you can clearly see which one is which.

```{r tidy-data-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r tidy-data-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_point(aes(color = ..., shape = ...))
```

```{r tidy-data-10-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(data = table1,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = cases)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country, shape = country))
```

```{r tidy-data-10-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

Technically you could tell before, but this will make it easier to see which one is which. When a categorical variable is mapped to an aesthetic, `ggplot()` will automatically assign a unique value of the aesthetic to each unique level of the variable, a process known as scaling.

### Exercise 11

Let's fix the x axis, we need to make just two breaks, 1999 and 2000. To do this, we will need to add a layer (using `+`). The layer we are going to add is `scale_x_continuous()`. We need to change what the breaks are, using `breaks = c(1999, 2000)`.

```{r tidy-data-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r tidy-data-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(..., ....))
```

```{r tidy-data-11-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(data = table1,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = cases)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country, shape = country)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2000))
```

```{r tidy-data-11-check}
grade_this_code()
```

###

The family of `scale_*` functions allows for fine-grained control of our plot axes.

## Lengthening Data
### 

The rules of tidy data might seem so obvious that you wonder if you’ll ever encounter data that isn’t tidy. Unfortunately, almost all real data is untidy, and you will need to clean it.

### Exercise 1

For this section, we will need to use the `billboard` dataset. Type and run `billboard` in the box below

```{r lengthening-data-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r lengthening-data-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
billboard
```

```{r lengthening-data-1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
billboard
```

```{r lengthening-data-1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

The `billboard` dataset consists of song rankings from the Billboard top 100 songs in the year 2000. This data is going to be extremely difficult to work with. It has *79* columns! Start a pipe with `billboard`.


### Exercise 2

Pipe `billboard` to `pivot_longer()`. We need to grab all the columns that start with `wk`, because that is something that all 76 of the "extra" columns have in common. We can do this by using `cols = starts_with("wk")` within the call to `pivot_longer()`.

```{r lengthening-data-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r lengthening-data-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
billboard |>
  pivot_longer(... = starts_with("..."))
```

```{r lengthening-data-2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
billboard |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"))
```

```{r lengthening-data-2-check}
grade_this_code()
```
### 

`cols` specifies which columns need to be pivoted, i.e. which columns aren’t variables. This argument uses the same syntax as `select()` so here we could use `!c(artist, track, date.entered)` or `contains("wk")`

### Exercise 3

What should we do with the new `name` and `value` columns?

We need to turn these 76 columns and all these observations into two columns: `rank` and `week`. We can do this by adding `names_to = "week"`, and `values_to = "rank` to `pivot_longer()`. (Make sure you have commas separating each argument.) 

```{r lengthening-data-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r lengthening-data-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
billboard |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"),
               names_to = "...",
               values_to = "...")
```

```{r lengthening-data-3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
billboard |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"),
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank")
```

```{r lengthening-data-3-check}
grade_this_code()
```
### 

`names_to` names the variable stored in the column names, we named that variable `week`. `values_to` names the variable stored in the cell values, we named that variable `rank`.


### Exercise 4

Now we need to get rid of all the NA's in the dataset. We can do this by using `values_drop_na = TRUE` inside `pivot_longer()`

```{r lengthening-data-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r lengthening-data-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
billboard |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"),
             names_to = "week",
             values_to = "rank",
             ... = TRUE)
```

```{r lengthening-data-4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
billboard |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"),
             names_to = "week",
             values_to = "rank",
             values_drop_na = TRUE)
```

```{r lengthening-data-4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

These NAs don’t really represent unknown observations; they were forced to exist by the structure of the dataset. So we can ask `pivot_longer()` to get rid of them by setting `values_drop_na = TRUE`.

### Exercise 5

Although this data is considered tidy, we can still clean it up to make it more understandable. We can get rid of all the extra `wk`'s in the `week` column to facilitate our plots.

### 

We do this by continuing our pipe with `mutate()`. Inside of `mutate()`, we can set `week` equal to `parse_number(week)`. This will get rid of all the `wk`'s, leaving just with numbers.

```{r lengthening-data-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r lengthening-data-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  mutate(... = parse_number(week))
```

```{r lengthening-data-5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
billboard |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"),
             names_to = "week",
             values_to = "rank",
             values_drop_na = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(week = parse_number(week))
```

```{r lengthening-data-5-check}
grade_this_code()
```
### 

With `mutate()` we can convert character strings to numbers. This way of using `mutate()` doesn't create a new column, but changes an existing column. `parse_number()` is a handy function that will extract the first number from a string, ignoring all other text.

### Exercise 6

Assign this mutated dataset to `billboard_longer`, using `<-`

```{r lengthening-data-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r lengthening-data-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
billboard_longer <- billboard |>
  pivot_longer(...) +
  ...
```

```{r lengthening-data-6-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
billboard_longer <- billboard |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wk"),
             names_to = "week",
             values_to = "rank",
             values_drop_na = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(week = parse_number(week))
```

```{r lengthening-data-6-check}
grade_this_code()
```

## Widening Data

Now, we need to learn about what we need to do with the really long datasets that need to be widened.

### 

`pivot_wider()` makes datasets wider by increasing columns and reducing rows. It helps when one observation is spread across multiple rows. This seems to arise less commonly in the wild, but it does seem to crop up a lot when dealing with governmental data, such as the Census.

### 

For this section, we'll be using the dataset `cms_patient_experience`, a patient experiences dataset from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services. 


### Exercise 1

In the Console, look up the help page for `cms_patient_experience` by using `?` before the name. Copy and paste the "Usage" section.

```{r widening-data-1-q}
question_text(NULL,
         answer_fn(function(value){
            if (str_remove_all(
              str_remove_all(str_to_lower(value), " "), 
              "\n") %in% 
                c("cms_patient_experiencecms_patient_care")) {
                 return(mark_as(TRUE))}
                 return(mark_as(FALSE) ) }),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	rows = 5)
```

### 

This gives you all the information for this data. What package it comes from, where the data is sourced from, and how to see and use the data.

This data comes from the package **tidyr**, so we won't need any other libraries other than the **tidyverse**.

### Exercise 2

Let's take a look at our data.

Type `cms_patient_experience` and hit "Run Code". 

```{r widening-data-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r widening-data-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
cms_patient_experience
```

```{r widening-data-2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
cms_patient_experience
```

```{r widening-data-2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

`cms_patient_experience` is a tibble with 5 columns and 500 observations. 

### 

This data is not tidy! In the columns `measure_cd` and `measure_title`, we have 6 repeating rows that would work much better as separate columns.

### Exercise 3

Pipe `cms_patient_experience` into `distinct()` with the variables `measure_cd` and `measure_title`.

```{r widening-data-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r widening-data-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
cms_patient_experience |> 
  distinct(measure_cd, measure_title)
```

```{r widening-data-3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
cms_patient_experience |> 
  distinct(measure_cd, measure_title)
```

```{r widening-data-3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

###

From this we can see that there are 6 distinct row that repeat within our data frame and also that `measure_title` uniquely identifies each `measure_cd`.

###

We want to tidy this data frame by making each `measure_cd` it's own column with the value set to `prf_rate`.

### Exercise 4

`pivot_wider()` includes many of the same arguments as `pivot_longer()`. Remember how we used `names_to` and `values_to` to make more columns from all the extra rows? Well, for `pivot_wider()`, we just have to do the opposite. We will use `names_to` and `values_to` to add more columns to this dataset.

###

Pipe `cms_patient_experience` to `pivot_wider()`, setting `names_from` equal to `measure_cd` and `values_from` equal to `prf_rate`.

```{r widening-data-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r widening-data-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
cms_patient_experience |> 
  pivot_wider(... = measure_cd,
              values_from = ...)
```

```{r widening-data-4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
cms_patient_experience |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = measure_cd,
              values_from = prf_rate)
```

```{r widening-data-4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

###

Notice that while this increased the number of columns it still does not look quite right. The length remained at 500 observations.


### Exercise 5

This data looks a little bit tidier, but there are still repeated rows in `org_nm` and `org_pac_id`. The reason they are still repeating is because of the `measure_title` variable. There are many ways we could resolve this issue.

###

Let's tell `pivot_wider` to uniquely identify the rows in every column (getting rid of duplicates). The columns we need to target are `org_pac_id` and `org_nm`. We can tell `pivot_wider()` to target these rows by adding `id_cols = starts_with("org")` to `pivot_wider()`.

```{r widening-data-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r widening-data-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
cms_patient_experience |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = measure_cd,
              values_from = prf_rate,
              id_cols = ...)
```

```{r widening-data-5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
cms_patient_experience |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = measure_cd,
              values_from = prf_rate,
              id_cols = starts_with("org"))
```

```{r widening-data-5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

This will get rid of any duplicate rows in the columns that start with "org'. And as we can see, there are many duplicates. `id_cols` cut the row count from 500 to 95.
